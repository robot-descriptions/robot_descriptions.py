Show a robot description, specified from the command line, using yourdfpy.

Note:
    See ``robot_descriptions/_command_line.py`` for a more advanced
    implementation, including the ability to set the robot configuration or
    show collision meshes.

This example requires `yourdfpy` which is an optional dependency. It can be
installed separately (``pip install yourdfpy``), or when robot descriptions are
installed via ``pip install robot_descriptions[cli]``.
